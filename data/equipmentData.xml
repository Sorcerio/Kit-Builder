The low profile design allows full use of scopes and iron sights while the Carbon Steel mesh provides optimum strength with maximum protection. The steel mesh performs extremely well holding up to very high BB velocity while providing great air flow reducing the chance of eye protection fogging up on you while in the middle of a game. Adjustable elastic head bands provide a secure fit allowing the mask to be custom tailored to user preference. Pair the Striker Gen2 mask with a good set of Full Seal Goggles and you have yourself one of the best possible choices for Airsoft face protection. </desc>

        <name>Marvel Licensed Deadpool Fabric Overhead Mask</name>
        <price>12.99</price>
        <store>Evike</store>
        <desc>Deadpool is one conflicted guy. He likes being flashy, but he also likes being a ninja. Designing a mask seemed hopeless for him, but he was able to compromise! This Deadpool Overhead Mask is made of fabric and combines the stealthy nature of a ninja mask with flashy red colors. Now, he can hide his hideous face AND look sort of like a ninja. Of course, you can wear it too, since one size fits most, but we have to warn you that wearing it does give you a massive hunger for chimichangas.</desc>

Made of a stretchy polyester microfiber material and done in a seamless tube shape they accommodate the vast majority of head sizes comfortably and can be folded up quite small for storage later. Even when imported a lot of places charge too much for these, we got a a good sized pile and wanted to offer them at a fair price. This design is a little different where dark brown is used on a Dusty Brown base to form the art . Most will wear it for the cool skull mask effects, but the rest of the design looks cool as a hat as well.  Approx 9.75" x 21".</desc>

        <price>6.00</price>
        <store>Evike</store>
        <desc>These multiwraps are super handy for helping keep the sun off your head and neck, sweat management, and from breathing in dust just as some starter uses! Made of a stretchy polyester microfiber material and done in a seamless tube shape they accommodate the vast majority of head sizes comfortably and can be folded up quite small for storage later. Even when imported a lot of places charge too much for these, we got a a good sized pile and wanted to offer them at a fair price. This design is a little different where dark brown is used on a Dusty Brown base to form the art . Most will wear it for the cool skull mask effects, but the rest of the design looks cool as a hat as well.  Approx 9.75" x 21".</desc>

A saddle shoulder design takes the weight of body armor without pinching or bunching while offering full freedom of movement. Large shoulder pockets provide quick and convenient storage, mesh panels offer enhanced breathability, and the integrated woven collar can be worn up or down. When you need to keep a low profile while retaining full mobility, the MultiCam Rapid Assault Shirt is the only choice.</desc>

        <desc>Tactical clothing can be costly. Workers, like those in the public safety sector, often have to make sacrifices to purchase the pants, shirts and jackets they wear to the office every day. With these price-conscious consumers in mind, Propper International released the Genuine Gear brand. Made to the same exacting standards as Propper's original line, the apparel is touted as the best value in the industry. Supremely focused on functionality, Genuine Gear products are durable and have many of the same characteristics as other higher-priced brands. Genuine Gear delivers a similar fit and performance but at half the cost for those operators on a budget.</desc>

        <desc>The Strike Industries plate carrier offers protection where you need it without the weight or bulk of others on the market.

The C.O.R.E features a breathable waistband able to hold side armor and a padded yoke for a secure, comfortable and breathable fit. Fits 10"x12" Plates front and back and features side pockets for 6"x8" side armor plates or additional gear.

The straps allow a rescue team to tactically conduct a rescue while maintaining their weapon and situational awareness.  </desc>

        <name>Mayflower Research and Development Law Enforcement Plate Carrier, (Color: Black /  Small and Medium)</name>
        <price>170.00</price>
        <store>Evike</store>
        <desc>The Mayflower RC by Velocity Systems Law Enforcement Plate Carrier (LEPC) was designed for ultimate modularity. The vest was designed with limited Molle and elastic cummerbunds for a sleek and clean look. The vest has large Velcro  Brand loop blocks on the front and back for ID as well as a drag handle. The front kangaroo pouch that accepts our magazine inserts found on the LEPC was modeled after the APC. What makes this system modular is the optional removable front Molle flap that allows you to easily add the optional quarter flaps. The quarter flaps house both soft or hard armor and allow the end user to dawn/doff from that single point without having to lift the front flap. The modularity of the LEPC also allows the use of multiple Velocity Systems cummerbund options that can be used with any of the above configurations. All of our Swiftclip placards work on all of the above mentioned configurations as well. The Law Enforcement Plate Carrier comes with the option of the Low-Profile Elastic Cummerbund (CBN1) (No Plate Pocket) and the Standard Molle, Plate Pocket Cummerbund (CBN3). The Standard Molle, Plate Pocket Cummerbund (CBN3) is designed to accept 6"x 6" hard armor plates or side soft armor inserts. The size small cummerbund has 5 complete columns of PALS. Size medium cummerbund has 6 complete columns of PALS. Size large cummerbund has 7 complete columns of PALS. All materials and workmanship are 100% made in the USA.</desc>

        <name>G-Code Contact Series 1.75" Operator Belt (Color: Black / Small)</name>
        <price>89.00</price>
        <store>Evike</store>
        <desc>G-Codes Operators Belt is a dual belt system that incorporates a lightweight inner belt with outward facing loop pile. This inner belt is intended to be worn by weaving through the trouser belt-loops and secures with a low profile buckle. The inner belt can easily serve as a full function tactical belt all on its own. However, as part of the system the inner belt forms a comfortable and stable foundation for the load bearing 1 3/4 inch over-belt. The over- belt is lined with a mating hook material and secures, outside the trouser loops to the inner belt. Together they form a solid, comfortable, low profile, load bearing system. Additionally, this system combines with G-Codes new Static-Grip mounting accessories that lock the placement of your carry items to the belt.</desc>

        <name>HSGI Sniper Waist Pack - Black</name>
        <price>48.00</price>
        <store>Evike</store>
        <desc>The Sniper Waist Pack was designed to be attached directly to a belt. Developed with direct input from Scout Sniper Instructors. The instructors wanted something the Snipers could not lose or could take off in case of an immediate EandE where the Marine would ditch everything except his weapon. This gave him enough Ammo/Food/Medical supplies to make it home. Made with 1000D Cordura. The end pockets are open end to end, in this channel one could put rope or countless other items. The next two pockets in from each end are Magazine Pouches. Each capable of holding up to 3 M4 Magazines, MRE's, or misc. life saving equipment. The center 4"x4"x3" pocket can be used for a Med Kit, Cleaning Kit, or anything the shooter thinks they'll need to keep them alive. This item is a great addition to any First Line Setup.</desc>

        <desc>When operators told 5.11 that they wanted a hard knuckle glove, they answered the challenge and created the HardTime. Starting with the excellent fit and performance of our Tac AK2, made with Kevlar fabric, we added our ergonomic articulated hard knuckle plates.  Instead of a single piece covering all four knuckles, our two plates flex with your hand, each covering two knuckles and improving your comfort, dexterity, and performance while protecting your knuckles from impact. Tough thermoplastic plates are padded on the hand side and covered with a durable subdued finish TPR laminate on the business side. Our HardTime gloves give you so much confidence, you'll have to resist the temptation to punch the nearest wall when you put them on!</desc>
